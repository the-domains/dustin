# Who is Dustin W. Stout?

On Feb. 17, 1985 in small town Sharon, Pennsylvania I came into the world. I was born to a hard-working bartender mom and a regional rock-star dad.

Ever since as far as I can remember I've had aspirations of telling stories on the big screen. Although my mother did name me after famous actor_Dustin Hoffman_, she never knew that I would some day pursue acting myself.

Being in every play, musical, and performing arts extra-curricular I could possibly keep up with, I did my best to prepare myself for the day I would venture out to Southern California. After graduating High School I immediately packed up and moved to Cali, enrolled at the_[American Academy of Dramatic Arts][0]_, Hollywood.

For two years I studied the various aspects of performing arts including_Acting for the Stage and Camera, Improv Comedy, Vocal Production, Standard American Dialect, Advanced Dialects and Accents, Musical Theater, Dance, Shakespeare,_and more.

After graduating I quickly realized that I couldn't just wait tables while I waited for my "big break", I had to work at something that gave me an outlet for my passion for storytelling.

After taking a position as a Youth Director and Graphic/Web Designer for my church, I began refining my ability to speak on a weekly basis in front of the toughest audience anyone could ever face--_teenagers_. For four years I taught between 1-2 times a week refining my ability to captivate even the most attention-deficit of audiences.

Once my blog took off and I had a steady stream of consulting (design, branding and social media) clients, I was able to begin working for myself as a digital marketing consultant. This is where I am today.

After being offered the _Chief Marketing Officer _position and part ownership of _[Weal Media][1]_, I welcomed the opportunity to take my freelance consulting to the next level.

And that's where I stand today.

I also launched a new business venture called_Warfare Plugins_in November of 2014\. We launched with a social sharing plugin called _[Social Warfare][2]_which aims to solve the greatest problems in getting content shared beautifully and effectively.
